🎓 I am a Ukrainian linguist specializing in phonetics, phonology, more specifically phonotactics of Slavic and Germanic languages, i.e., a study of rules and patterns governing permissible combinations of sounds in a particular language. In my research, I employ corpus linguistic methods and natural language processing (Python).

👶 My interests also extend to the field of child language acquisition and sociolinguistics.

🌐 At the moment, I am actively involved in developing a website dedicated to (mor)phonotactics and enhancing [the Net Auditory Distance Calculator](https://wa.amu.edu.pl/nadcalc/) - a tool developed at [the Faculty of English](https://anglistyka.amu.edu.pl/en) to calculate cluster preferences of various languages.

💼 In my free time, I am a freelance translator and interpreter of Ukrainian, English, Polish, and Russian and a passionate mountaineer 🏔️.
