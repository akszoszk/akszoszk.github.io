I am a Ukrainian linguist specializing in phonetics, phonology, and child language acquisition. My research focuses on the phonotactics of predominantly Slavic and Germanic languages, and I employ corpus linguistic techniques and natural language processing in my studies. 
At the moment, I am actively involved in developing a website dedicated to (mor)phonotactics and enhancing <a href='https://wa.amu.edu.pl/nadcalc/'>the Net Auditory Distance Calculator</a>.
